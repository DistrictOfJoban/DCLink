# DCLink

## Why
I can't find a decent Discord Chat Linking Bot that suits my need and runs on 1.17.1

[Chatter](https://github.com/axieum/chatter) is what I used to use, but it's on 1.16.5.
While a newer rewritten mod, [Minecord](https://github.com/axieum/minecord) is only available for 1.19.

Unfortunately I don't have enough understanding of the code to port either of the mod to 1.17, so I made my own mod (Where I'll probably forget the code in about a year or so)

What a great idea!

## Features
- Runs on Fabric 1.17.1
- Can reload config
- Support bot activities
- Support showing replied message from Discord to MC
- Automatically fetch custom guild emoji, show properly when relaying to Discord

### Supported Server Events to be relayed to Discord
- Server Starting / Started / Stopping / Stopped
- Server Crash

### Supported Player Events to be relayed to Discord
- Player Join
- Player Leave
- Player send chat message (Including commands)
- Player entering another dimension
- Player Death (WIP)

## Future Goals
- Check the status of the bot with commands
- Player Advancement Events
- Relay Discord Reaction Event to Minecraft
- Allow exporting config to other Discord relaying mod
- Support for 1.17 - 1.19
- Touch some grass
