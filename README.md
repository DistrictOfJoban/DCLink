# DCLink

I can't find a decent Discord Chat Linking Bot that suits my need and runs on 1.17.1

[Chatter](https://github.com/axieum/chatter) is what I used to use, but it's on 1.16.5.
While a newer rewritten mod, [Minecord](https://github.com/axieum/minecord) is only available for 1.19.

Unfortunately I don't have enough understanding of the code to port either of the mod to 1.17, so I made my own mod that links to Discord, where I'll probably forget the code in about a year or so.

Stonks!
